            <h1>Mission Statement</h1>
            <p>Our mission is to work towards a more accepting environment for all people, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity through education, support, social action, and advocacy.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>She grounds her work solidly in racial, economic and social justice. This approach to leadership has delivered results as diverse as: winning an LGBT-inclusive federal hate crimes prevention law; defeating multiple state anti-LGBT ballot measures; spotlighting discrimination against transgender people; winning marriage equality; building stronger support for fair immigration reform; and, successfully securing scores of changes in federal agencies to attend to the needs of the LGBTQ community.</p>
