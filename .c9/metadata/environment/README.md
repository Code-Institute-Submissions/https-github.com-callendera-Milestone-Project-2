{"changed":true,"filter":false,"title":"README.md","tooltip":"/README.md","value":"# Milestone Project 2\n## Check out my website [here](https://callendera.github.io/Milestone-Project-2/)\n## Objective\nMy second Milestone Project is a website for a Non-Profit organization founded by myself and fellow LGBTQ+ community member Erin Munoz.\nOur Organization is the Fayette County PRIDE Foundation. The organization is in the begining stages, so a website to gain community support and to get people involved is very important.\nThis project also displays the skills learned in the modules leading up to this project including:\nHTML Fundamentals, CSS Fundamentals, User Centric Frontend Developement, JavaScript, and Interactive Frontend Developement.\nBy adding Javascript and Interactive Frontend Developement to my skill set, I have added to the user interactions within my site. \nNot only does the site have excellent UX, but it allows the user to interact and become involved in our Organization.\n## Project Description and UX\nThe goal of this website is to provide a place where users can:\n* Make Donations\n* Learn about our organization\n* Recieve event updates/See upcomming events\n* Get Sponsorship details\n* Discover our Social Media pages\n* Submit Volunteer Application \n* Print Vendor Application\n* Subscribe to our Quarterly News Letter\n\nThe site is fully functional on all screen sizes with extensive testing for each feature. The site is meant to have a minimalist aesthetic to give a modern feel.\n\n* User Stories:\n    * As someone who is interested in making a donation, I visit the organizations landing page. On that page there is an option to donate in the Navbar. \n    I click on the button and am redirected to the GofundMe page for Fayette County PRIDE where the user can make a donation.\n    * I am interested in finding out about the organization and requesting more information. I visit the page and hit the 'About Us' option in the Navbar\n    and am directed to the section that gives the organization's background and purpose for work. There is also an option to 'Learn More' that directs the user to the subscription form \n    that allows them to request more information. \n    After the user completes and submits the form they will see a message that says 'Sent!' after receiving the form the user will recieve an email from an organization member acknowledging the receipt of the subscription form and with the information requested. \n    * I am a user trying to check out upcoming events. Upon comming to the landing page I click on the Nav Link for 'Events' and am directed to the timeline that displays the events.\n    From there the evnts are listed with dates and addresses. There is also a Google Map API that shows the user exactly where each event is being held. The user can also request event updates through the subsription form.\n    * I am interested in becoming a volunteer for an event throught the organization. I come to the landing page and click the volunteer navigation and am directed to the volunteer application. \n    Upon completing and sending the application a message appears that says 'Sent!' upon recieving the form a member of the organization emails a confirmation of receiving the form. \n    Also, on the landing page, when you scroll another option to beome a volunteer is available. This option leads you to the same page, but includes a short snippet of text for the user to give context about volunteering for the organization.\n    * I am a user that is interested in becoming a sponsor. After landing on the home page I select the sponsorship option in the Navbar and am directed to the subscription form where the user can request sponsorship information.\n    Just like above, the user will fill out the form and send it. The message will appear that confirms the form is sent. The user will recieve an email from an organization member acknowledging the receipt of the subscription form and with the information requested.\n    * I am a vendor who woud like to purchase a spot at an upcoming event. After coming to the landing page and scrolling down to the vendor application is available in a pinatble PDF version. A modal pulls up with an option to print the PDF.\n    I click on the 'Print PDF' button and the PDF pulls up in the browser in a seperate tab.\n\n### Original Mockup\n\n![Original Mockup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callendera/Milestone-Project-2/master/assets/images/WF.jpg)\n \n### Revamped Mockup\n \n ![Revamped Mockup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callendera/Milestone-Project-2/master/assets/images/WF1.png) \n ![Revamped Mockup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callendera/Milestone-Project-2/master/assets/images/WF2.png)\n ![Revamped Mockup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callendera/Milestone-Project-2/master/assets/images/WF3.png)\n ![Revamped Mockup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callendera/Milestone-Project-2/master/assets/images/WF4.png)\n \n## Features\n\n### Existing Features\n* Navbar \n    * Fixed to the top for easy navigation \n    * Organization Logo in left corner\n    * Includes: Home|Volunteer|About Us|Events|Sponsorship Each navigates you through the site in decending order\n    * Donate button linked to GoFundMe page\n    * Navigation links become a toggler in the mobile veiw and smaller screen sizes\n* Volunteer, Vendor Application, Donate\n    * These sets of divs are to allow the user to scroll through the options they have to get involved.\n    * The image provides good UX for each section\n    * The div containing the short context and button to \"Learn More\" either links the user to a PDF(vendor application), a second page within the site(volunteer application), or to the GoFundMe page(donations) \n        * Vendor Application - Available in PDF form only to provide an appropriate screening process for our vendors.
