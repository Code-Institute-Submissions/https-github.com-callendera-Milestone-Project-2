# Milestone Project 2
## Check out my website [here](https://callendera.github.io/Milestone-Project-2/)
## Objective
My second Milestone Project is a website for a Non-Profit organization founded by myself and fellow LGBTQ+ community member Erin Munoz.
Our Organization is the Fayette County PRIDE Foundation. The organization is in the begining stages, so a website to gain community support and to get people involved is very important.
This project also displays the skills learned in the modules leading up to this project including:
HTML Fundamentals, CSS Fundamentals, User Centric Frontend Developement, JavaScript, and Interactive Frontend Developement.
By adding Javascript and Interactive Frontend Developement to my skill set, I have added to the user interactions within my site. 
Not only does the site have excellent UX, but it allows the user to interact and become involved in our Organization.
## Project Description and UX
The goal of this website is to provide a place where users can:
* Make Donations
* Learn about our organization
* Recieve event updates/See upcomming events
* Get Sponsorship details
* Discover our Social Media pages
* Submit Volunteer Application 
* Print Vendor Application
* Subscribe to our Quarterly News Letter

The site is fully functional on all screen sizes with extensive testing for each feature. The site is meant to have a minimalist aesthetic to give a modern feel.

* User Stories:
    * As someone who is interested in making a donation, I visit the organizations landing page. On that page there is an option to donate in the Navbar. 
    I click on the button and am redirected to the GofundMe page for Fayette County PRIDE where the user can make a donation.
    * I am interested in finding out about the organization and requesting more information. I visit the page and hit the 'About Us' option in the Navbar
    and am directed to the section that gives the organization's background and purpose for work.
